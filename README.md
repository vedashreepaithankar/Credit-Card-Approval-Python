# Credit Card Approval Prediction

This project aims to predict credit card approvals using machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains various attributes of credit card applicants and their approval status. UCI Credit Approval Dataset is used for this project

## Project Overview

- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables
- Exploratory data analysis: Visualizing approval distribution and feature importance
- Model implementation: Testing multiple classification algorithms
- Model evaluation: Comparing performance metrics across different models

## Key Steps

1. Data loading and initial exploration
2. Handling missing values using various imputation techniques
3. Encoding categorical variables using Ordinal Encoding
4. Splitting data into training and testing sets
5. Implementing and evaluating multiple classifiers:
   - Decision Tree
   - Gradient Boosting
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Logistic Regression

## Results

Logistic Regression achieved the best balance between training and test accuracy, indicating good generalization.
